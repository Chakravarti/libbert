LibBERT is a BERT (Binary ERlang Term) library for C++ and C.

BERT is a format for encoding binary data. You can think of it as JSON for binary formats. BERT is based on [[http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html][Erlang's External Format]].

bert.h is the C API (you need to link -lbert_capi!). bert.hpp is the C++ API (header only).

See http://bert-rpc.org/

This library is written by RÃ¼diger Sonderfeld <ruediger@c-plusplus.de>. Some basic stuff (CMake setup etc.) is copied from the Flusspferd project (http://flusspferd.org).

Thanks to Nikolas Bowe for his contributions.

The library is licensed under the [[https://github.com/ruediger/Beerzlib-License][beerzlib license]]. The beerzlib license is a modified zlib license. It contains an additional clause that encourages users to send beer (or other beverages or gifts) to the developers. See the file /license/ for the full text of the license.
