LibBERT is a BERT (Binary ERlang Term) library for C++ and C.

BERT is a format for encoding binary data. You can think of it as JSON for binary formats. BERT is based on Erlang's External Format (http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html).

The C and C++ API are seperate and you get a nice C++ API! Nothing build on top of C which doesn't really look like C++! (Actually the C API is build on top of the C++ API and not the other way arround!)

bert.h is the C API (you need to link -lbert_capi!). bert.hpp is the C++ API (header only).

This library is currently under heavy development!
